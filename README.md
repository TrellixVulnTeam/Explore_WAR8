## Introduction

 The Explore landing page is a project that I am building while I am learning and practicing my SCSS skills.
 For this project my goal is to learn how to use SCSS, including mixins, variables, fucntions, grids, animations and archtectures.

## Technologies
  - HTML
  - SCSS

## Features

- The user can visit the page and discover tours to explore the nature. The company offers tours for different levels of abilities and different sizes of parties.

  - Implement an API call for the different tours.
